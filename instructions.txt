Follow the set of instructions to categorize the files above:

Rules:
remove the asteriks and do not add extra fluff
only give me the subject name of the folder name that is generated (i.e Chemistry, Family, Selfies)
make the folders more broad (i.e cats and dogs would both be in an animals folder)
do not add standard names such as textfiles or images
Do not add colons to the subject name
Separate each file by spaces
Do not print the contents of each file

Follow this example format:
Foldername file1 file2 file3
Map America.txt Europe.txt
Receipt publixReceipt.txt HomeDepotReceipt.txt
Person Person.jpg
Math math.png

1. give me a list of folders to divide the files above into based on subjects
2. after the name of each folder add the names of the files that should be added to that folder
